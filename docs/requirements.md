# Requirements

We need some Tools to get our development environment running:

- Linux, that could be your main OS or also running within WSL
- Docker (when running within WSL, then you could just install Docker Desktop)
- Docker compose (this will usually be installed together with Docker)
- .Net Runtime 9.0, since the tool is written with C# (how to install it, will be explanined in the install section)

If you want to use the command "webdev project start" you will need also:
- NodeJS
- Devcontainer CLI

WebDev will check if those are installed and will install them if he canÂ´t find them.
