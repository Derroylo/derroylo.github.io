# Development

GPT is developed with [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io) and there is a ready to use config if you want to contribute, test some stuff or just take a look on how it works internally. Just click on the Button "Open in Gitpod" in the [Readme.md](https://github.com/Derroylo/gitpod-tool) near the bottom.
