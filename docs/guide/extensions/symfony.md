# Symfony extension examples

## Introduction
On this page you can find some examples for symfony extensions. These might not be up to date, so make sure to check my current [sample workspace for symfony](https://github.com/Derroylo/symfony-workspace-sample/tree/main/.devEnv/gitpod/scripts/symfony)

::: info
If you have a good extension idea which should be implemented, create a new issue [here](https://github.com/Derroylo/symfony-workspace-sample/issues) or head over to the [Gitpod discord server](https://discord.com/invite/gitpod) to contact me directly.
