# Update Command

The purpose of the update command is to install the latest version of GPT if there is a newer version available. GPT itself will check every 4 hours if there is a new version available and inform you.

::: info
In older versions, downloading a new version of GPT needed to be done after every workspace restart. This has been changed in Version 0.4 where the new version will be moved to the workspace folder, so it will be saved and can be reused after a restart.
