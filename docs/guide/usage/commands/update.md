# Update Command

The purpose of the update command is to install the latest version of GPT if there is a newer version available. GPT itself will check every 4 hours if there is a new version available and inform you.

::: warning
Since GPT is currently installed in the user directory, it is not persistent. This means that if you update GPT, you will have to do it again after each restart of the workspace.
