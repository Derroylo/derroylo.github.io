# Xdebug

## Introduction

Xdebug has been a love-hate for most of the php developers as it is awesome when it is works reliable but is a pain to troubleshoot if it doesn´t work. Thanks to Gitpod we longer need to take care about port forwarding from the container where our Webserver is running to our local system where the IDE is running. And we don´t even want to start about using it reliable under Windows with Docker Desktop and WSL.

With the release of Xdebug 3.x it got a lot better as lot´s of settings have been removed as before it wasn´t really that easy to find out what setting had to be set to which value to get it working.

With that being said we will cover everything around Xdebug in this Howto starting with the installation, how to set which setting, meaning of the different modes and how to use it in different IDE´s and Tools.
