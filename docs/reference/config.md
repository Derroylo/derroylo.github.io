# Config <Badge type="info" text="since v0.4.0" />

In this section general config settings will be explained.

The following example shows all settings that can be set and which will be explained on this page:

```yaml:line-numbers {1}
config:
  allowPreReleases: true
```

## allowPreReleases <Badge type="info" text="since v0.4.0" />
If you want to use releases that are not marked yet as stable, you can change this setting to `true` and if available, update to them via `gpt update`.

```yaml:line-numbers {1}
config:
  allowPreReleases: true
```
