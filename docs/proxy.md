# Proxy

## Short explaination

Usually you could reach your application via `http://localhost:8080` from your browser. When using the proxy, you can use https and even define the URL under which your application is reachable, for example `https://example.dev.localhost`. Many websites have a redirect for www integrated, so `https://www.example.dev.localhost` is available too. Via `webdev.yml` you can define custom subdomains, for example for different languages or multi tenant systems.
